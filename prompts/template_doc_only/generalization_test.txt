# GLOBAL EVALUATION MODE (You are not allowed to modify documentation file)

**Evaluation Mode: Documentation-Only Evaluation**

You are **not allowed** to:

* Execute code or rerun experiments
* Simulate outputs or construct new examples
* Access code, plan files, notebooks, or codewalks
* Use external documents or background knowledge

You are **only allowed** to:

* Read the documentation files provided for this evaluation

All judgments must be based **solely on explicit statements in the documentation**.
Missing, implicit, or underspecified information **counts as absent**.

Here is the repo_path:
`{REPO_PATH}`

and the documentation file path:
`{REPO_PATH}/logs/documentation.pdf`

# 3. GENERALIZATION EVALUATION — DOCUMENTATION ONLY

## ROLE

You are a **Generalizability Evaluator**.

Your job is to evaluate whether the **findings reported in the documentation** are justified as **generalizable beyond the original experimental setting**, based **only on explicit arguments provided in the documentation**.

You do **not** execute new experiments, test new models, or introduce new data.

---

## INPUT

Use only the documentation at:

`{REPO_PATH}/logs/documentation.pdf`

Do **not** access code, plan files, datasets, or external references.

---

## GOAL

Evaluate generalizability using the following **binary checklist**, based on whether the documentation provides **explicit, well-reasoned justification** for generalization.

Assertions without argument **do not count**.

---

## GENERALIZABILITY CHECKLIST

If you think the documentation is not sufficient for you to evaluate, you should return NA for the checklist.

---

### **GT1. Generalization to a New Model**

**PASS** — The documentation explicitly explains **why the identified mechanism or finding should transfer to a different model**, based on architectural properties, mechanistic reasoning, or stated invariances.
**FAIL** — Generalization to other models is asserted without mechanistic explanation, or not addressed at all.

The explanation must go beyond stating that the model is “similar” or “also a transformer.”

---

### **GT2. Generalization to New Data**

**PASS** — The documentation explicitly states **assumptions or conditions** under which the finding should hold on new or unseen data, and explains why those assumptions are reasonable.
**FAIL** — Generalization to new data is asserted without explicit assumptions, justification, or scope.

Vague statements such as “should generalize broadly” are insufficient.

---

### **GT3. Method / Specificity Generalizability**

If the documentation proposes a **new method or analysis procedure**, evaluate this item.
If no new method is proposed, mark **GT3 = NA**.

**PASS** — The documentation explicitly argues that the method can be applied to other similar tasks or settings, explaining what properties are required.
**FAIL** — Method generality is claimed without justification, or applicability conditions are unspecified.
**NA** — No new method is proposed.

---

## **3.1 Output Format and Location**

You must produce **two files** under:

```
{REPO_PATH}/doc_only_evaluation/
```

---

### **A. Jupyter Notebook**

**Path:**
`{REPO_PATH}/doc_only_evaluation/generalization_eval.ipynb`

The notebook must include, in order:

1. **Evaluation notes** for GT1, GT2, and GT3, citing specific documentation statements.
2. A **binary checklist table** summarizing GT1–GT3 (PASS / FAIL / NA).
3. A **short summary** describing the overall generalizability assessment.

Do **not** include any executed code or constructed examples.

---

### **B. JSON Summary File**

**Path:**
`{REPO_PATH}/doc_only_evaluation/generalization_eval_summary.json`

It must contain the following structure:

```json
{{
  "Checklist": {{
    "GT1_ModelGeneralization": "PASS" or "FAIL",
    "GT2_DataGeneralization": "PASS" or "FAIL",
    "GT3_MethodGeneralization": "PASS" or "FAIL" or "NA"
  }},

  "Rationale": {{
    "GT1_ModelGeneralization": "Why PASS or FAIL",
    "GT2_DataGeneralization": "Why PASS or FAIL",
    "GT3_MethodGeneralization": "Why PASS or FAIL or NA"
  }}
}}
```
