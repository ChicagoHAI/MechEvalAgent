# GLOBAL EVALUATION MODE (You are not allowed to execute code)

**Evaluation Mode: Read-Only Replication Evaluation (No Execution)**

You are **not allowed** to:

* Execute code or rerun experiments
* Write or run new code to verify results
* Simulate outputs or construct test cases

You are **allowed** to:

* Read all files under the repository
* Inspect plan files, codewalks, source code, and documentation
* Reason about replicability by **static inspection only**

All judgments must be based **solely on explicit information available in the repository**.
If replication would require guessing missing details or observing runtime behavior, it **must be marked as FAIL**.

Here is the repo_path:
`{REPO_PATH}`

# 4. REPLICATION EVALUATION

## ROLE

You are an **independent replication evaluator**.

Your task is to determine whether the experiment described in the repository can be **faithfully reconstructed by a third party**, **without executing the original code**, based only on the information provided.

You do **not** attempt replication.
You only evaluate whether replication is **possible in principle**.

---

## MATERIALS YOU MAY READ

You may read **all materials under the REPO**:

`{REPO_PATH}`

This includes (if present):

* Plan file
* Codewalk file
* Source code
* Documentation

You must **not** rely on execution or runtime outputs.

---

## GOAL

Evaluate replicability using the following **binary checklist**, based strictly on **information sufficiency and clarity**.

If faithful replication would require assumptions, missing details, or execution-dependent behavior, mark **FAIL**.

---

## REPLICATION CHECKLIST — BINARY

---

### **RP1. Implementation Reconstructability**

**PASS** — The repository describes the experimental procedure, analysis steps, and evaluation logic with enough operational detail that an independent researcher could reimplement the experiment step-by-step without guesswork, based on static inspection alone.
**FAIL** — Critical steps, ordering, logic, or implementation details are missing, ambiguous, or only implicitly specified.

High-level descriptions without operational detail are insufficient.

---

### **RP2. Environment Reproducibility**

**PASS** — The repository explicitly specifies required models, datasets, configurations, and key dependencies, including versions or acquisition methods, such that the environment can be reconstructed without trial-and-error.
**FAIL** — One or more required resources are missing, ambiguous, underspecified, or depend on unstated defaults.

Statements like “standard setup” or “default parameters” without definition are insufficient.

---

### **RP3. Determinism and Stability**

**PASS** — The repository explicitly addresses sources of nondeterminism (e.g., random seeds, sampling, stochastic components) and explains how stability is ensured or how variability is interpreted.
**FAIL** — Randomness, nondeterminism, or result instability is unaddressed or left implicit.

---

## **4.1 Output Format and Location**

You must produce **two files** under:

```
{REPO_PATH}/no_exe_evaluation/replications/
```

---

### **A. Evaluation File**

**Path:**
`{REPO_PATH}/no_exe_evaluation/replications/no_exe_evaluation_replication.md`
*(or `.ipynb` if preferred for consistency)*

The file must include, in order:

1. **Evaluation notes** for RP1–RP3, explicitly stating what information is sufficient or missing.
2. A **binary checklist table** covering RP1–RP3.
3. A **short summary** describing overall replicability under read-only inspection.

Do **not** include executed code or inferred details.

---

### **B. JSON Summary File**

**Path:**
`{REPO_PATH}/no_exe_evaluation/replications/self_replication_evaluation.json`

It must contain the following structure:

```json
{{
  "Checklist": {{
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "PASS" or "FAIL",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "PASS" or "FAIL",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "PASS" or "FAIL"
  }},

  "Rationale": {{
    "RP1_ImplementationReconstructability": "Why PASS or FAIL",
    "RP2_EnvironmentReproducibility": "Why PASS or FAIL",
    "RP3_DeterminismAndStability": "Why PASS or FAIL"
  }}
}}
```
